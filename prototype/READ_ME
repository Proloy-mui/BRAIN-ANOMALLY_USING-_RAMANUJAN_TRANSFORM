Detailed Notebook Process Overview

The Jupyter Notebook `EEG2.ipynb` is structured as follows:

1. **Data Loading and Inspection**  
   - Load raw EEG data from files or datasets  
   - Visualize sample EEG signals to understand data quality

2. **Signal Preprocessing**  
   - Apply filtering to remove noise and baseline wander  
   - Handle missing data and artifacts

3. **Feature Extraction using Ramanujan Transform**  
   - Compute Ramanujan Periodic Transform coefficients to capture periodic patterns in EEG signals  
   - Extract relevant features that highlight brain activity anomalies

4. **Model Training and Evaluation**  
   - Split data into training and testing sets  
   - Train machine learning classifiers such as SVM, Random Forest, or others  
   - Evaluate models using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices

5. **Visualization and Interpretation**  
   - Plot feature distributions and classification results  
   - Interpret the model performance and potential clinical relevance

6. **Conclusion and Future Work**  
   - Summarize findings  
   - Discuss limitations and next steps
